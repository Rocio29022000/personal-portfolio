<h1> About me </h1>
            <h3> Personal profile</h3>
            <p>My passion for innovation in technology, especially in the MedTech industry, 
                drove me to pursue an integrated masterâ€™s in medical engineering. 
                I am currently a Graduate Market Strategist at CMR Surgical supporting the 
                Vision & Digital portfolios strategy. This has enabled me to apply my research 
                and analytical skills to develop market insights for business case development 
                as well as my communication skills to engage with key stakeholders. 
                I would like to continue using and enhancing these skills to help drive growth 
                and impact the future of technology, especially within the MedTech industry.
