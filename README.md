# personal-portfolio
### What is the website on?
Personal portfolio is going to be a website for my personal portfolio, kindof like an interactive CV, with much more.
To begin with the Home page will only be a short version covering each section, which eventually will be set into articles and sections where you can click learn more to go to the individual pages to get more content out of it. (for example, Projets article where the sections have a title and short summary for each project and you can click learn more and redirect you to a page with all the projects, images, videos etc).
Initially the home page will be based around my CV (This is not what the final model will look like, but will be like this to start getting the hang of things and build up on it slowly)

### What will I be using?
Atm I have added some CSS (initial) Lab 05.
I will add some prompts for the JavaScript lab 06 but I will likely remove these in the future.


### Applying html to the structure
